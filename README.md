The ipython package for R allows communication with jupyter kernels from within R sessions. 

You will be able to send python commands for execution in jupyter kernels, and get the result back. 

An engine for knitr is also provided, that allows the compilation of R notebooks that contain python code, see for instance https://github.com/mwouts/ipython_from_R/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-ipython.Rmd
